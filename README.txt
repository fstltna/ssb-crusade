~~~~ DIRECTX AND GRAPHICS DRIVER ERRORS ~~~~

If the game is not running on startup and giving you an error message, first try restarting your computer.
If this keeps happening, you likely do not have the latest DirectX or graphics drivers installed.

If slowdown occurs, consider lowering your game resolution and turning on frameskip on the opening screen.


~~~~ ONLINE MODE ~~~~

Online play is peer-to-peer, so in order to protect your privacy we recommend using a program such
as LogMeIn Hamachi or Evolve to protect your IP address.


~~~~ CONTROLLER SUPPORT ~~~~

This game currently does not natively support controller play.  In order to use your favorite controller,
use a program such as Joy2Key or Xpadder to map out the inputs to keyboard inputs.

In this setup, we recommend setting up joystick tilts as walking and joystick smash as running.
